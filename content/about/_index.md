## ~/Whoami$ 

I don’t chase vulnerabilities; they reveal themselves to those who understand the language of systems. Firewalls, packets, and encrypted whispers—I listen where others overlook.

I’ve learned that security isn’t just about defense; it’s about knowing where the cracks begin. From compromising the intentionally weak to fortifying the strong, my path is one of understanding, not destruction.

I am not the loudest in the room, nor the fastest on the keyboard. But in the silence between requests and responses, in the heartbeat of network traffic—I see what others miss.
